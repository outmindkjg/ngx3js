		<h2>Constructor</h2>
		<h3>[constructor:Raycaster Raycaster](  [param:Vector3 origin]?,  [param:Vector3 direction]?,  [param:number near]?,  [param:number far]? )</h3>
		<h4>Parameters</h4>
		<p>
			[parameter:Vector3 origin] - (optional) The origin vector where the ray casts from.<br />
			[parameter:Vector3 direction] - (optional) The direction vector that gives direction to the ray. Should be normalized.<br />
			[parameter:number near] - (optional) All results returned are further away than near. Near can't be negative. Default value is 0.<br />
			[parameter:number far] - (optional) All results returned are closer then far. Far can't be lower then near . Default value is Infinity.
		</p>
		<p>
			This creates a new raycaster object.
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<h3>[property:Camera camera]</h3>
		<p>
			The camera to use when raycasting against view-dependent objects such as billboarded objects like Sprites. This field<br />
			can be set manually or is set when calling "setFromCamera".
		</p>

		<h3>[property:number far]</h3>
		<p>
			The far factor of the raycaster. This value indicates which objects can be discarded based on the<br />
			distance. This value shouldn't be negative and should be larger than the near property.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Layers layers]</h3>
		<p>
			Used by Raycaster to selectively ignore 3D objects when performing intersection tests.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:number near]</h3>
		<p>
			The near factor of the raycaster. This value indicates which objects can be discarded based on the<br />
			distance. This value shouldn't be negative and should be smaller than the far property.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:RaycasterParameters params]</h3>
		<p>
			
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Ray ray]</h3>
		<p>
			The Ray used for the raycasting.
		</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<h3>[method:Intersection[] intersectObject](  [param:Object3D object],  [param:boolean recursive]?,  [param:Intersection[] optionalTarget]? )</h3>
		<h4>Parameters</h4>
		<p>
			[parameter:Object3D object] - The object to check for intersection with the ray.<br />
			[parameter:boolean recursive] - (optional) If true, it also checks all descendants. Otherwise it only checks intersecton with the object. Default is false.<br />
			[parameter:Intersection[] optionalTarget] - (optional) (optional) target to set the result. Otherwise a new Array is instantiated. If set, you must clear this array prior to each call (i.e., array.length = 0;).
		</p>
		<p>
			Checks all intersection between the ray and the object with or without the descendants. Intersections are returned sorted by distance, closest first.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Intersection[] intersectObjects](  [param:Object3D[] objects],  [param:boolean recursive]?,  [param:Intersection[] optionalTarget]? )</h3>
		<h4>Parameters</h4>
		<p>
			[parameter:Object3D[] objects] - The objects to check for intersection with the ray.<br />
			[parameter:boolean recursive] - (optional) If true, it also checks all descendants of the objects. Otherwise it only checks intersecton with the objects. Default is false.<br />
			[parameter:Intersection[] optionalTarget] - (optional) (optional) target to set the result. Otherwise a new Array is instantiated. If set, you must clear this array prior to each call (i.e., array.length = 0;).
		</p>
		<p>
			Checks all intersection between the ray and the objects with or without the descendants.<br />
			Intersections are returned sorted by distance, closest first.<br />
			Intersections are of the same form as those returned by .intersectObject.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:void set](  [param:Vector3 origin],  [param:Vector3 direction] )</h3>
		<h4>Parameters</h4>
		<p>
			[parameter:Vector3 origin] - The origin vector where the ray casts from.<br />
			[parameter:Vector3 direction] - The normalized direction vector that gives direction to the ray.
		</p>
		<p>
			Updates the ray with a new origin and direction.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:void setFromCamera](  [param:any coords],  [param:Camera camera] )</h3>
		<h4>Parameters</h4>
		<p>
			[parameter:any coords] - 2D coordinates of the mouse, in normalized device coordinates (NDC)---X and Y components should be between -1 and 1.<br />
			[parameter:Camera camera] - camera from which the ray should originate
		</p>
		<p>
			Updates the ray with a new origin and direction.
