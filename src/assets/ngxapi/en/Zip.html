		<h1>Zip</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			A zippable archive to which files can incrementally be added
		</p>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>
				<h3>[constructor:Zip Zip](  [param:AsyncFlateStreamHandler cb]? )</h3>
		<h4>Parameters</h4>
		<p>
			[parameter:AsyncFlateStreamHandler cb] - (optional) The callback to call whenever data for the generated ZIP archive
          is available
		</p>
		<p>
			Creates an empty ZIP archive to which files can be added
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>
				<h3>[property:AsyncFlateStreamHandler ondata]</h3>
		<p>
			The handler to call whenever data is available
		</p>


		<h2>Methods</h2>
				<h3>[method:void add](  [param:ZipInputFile file] )</h3>
		<h4>Parameters</h4>
		<p>
			[parameter:ZipInputFile file] - The file stream to add
		</p>
		<p>
			Adds a file to the ZIP archive
		</p>

		<h3>[method:void end](  )</h3>
		<p>
			Ends the process of adding files and prepares to emit the final chunks.<br />
			This <i>must</i> be called after adding all desired files for the resulting<br />
			ZIP file to work properly.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:void terminate](  )</h3>
		<p>
			A method to terminate any internal workers used by the stream. Subsequent calls to add() will fail.
		</p>


		<h2>Interfaces</h2>
		<h3 id="ZipInputFile" class="interface">[page:ZipAttributes] &rarr; ZipInputFile <i class="modifier modifier-interface">Interface</i></h3>
		<h4>Properties</h4>
		<p>
			[property:number attrs]? - The file's attributes. These are traditionally somewhat complicated and platform-dependent, so using them is scarcely necessary. However, here is a representation of what this is, bit by bit:<br />
			`TTTTugtrwxrwxrwx0000000000ADVSHR`<br />
			TTTT = file type (rarely useful)<br />
			u = setuid, g = setgid, t = sticky<br />
			rwx = user permissions, rwx = group permissions, rwx = other permissions<br />
			0000000000 = unused<br />
			A = archive, D = directory, V = volume label, S = system file, H = hidden, R = read-only<br />
			If you want to set the Unix permissions, for instance, just bit shift by 16, e.g. 0644 &lt;&lt; 16<br />
			[property:string comment]? - The comment to attach to the file. This field is defined by PKZIP's APPNOTE.txt, section 4.4.26. The comment must be at most 65,535 bytes long UTF-8 encoded. This field is not read by consumer software.<br />
			[property:number compression] - The compression format for the data stream. This number is determined by the spec in PKZIP's APPNOTE.txt, section 4.4.5. For example, 0 = no compression, 8 = deflate, 14 = LZMA<br />
			[property:number crc] - A CRC of the original file contents. This attribute may be invalid after the file is added to the ZIP archive; it must be correct only before the stream completes.<br />
			If you don't want to have to generate this yourself, consider extending the ZipPassThrough class and overriding its process() method, or using one of ZipDeflate or AsyncZipDeflate.<br />
			[property:Record extra]? - Extra metadata to add to the file. This field is defined by PKZIP's APPNOTE.txt, section 4.4.28. At most 65,535 bytes may be used in each ID. The ID must be an integer between 0 and 65,535, inclusive.<br />
			This field is incredibly rare and almost never needed except for compliance with proprietary standards and software.<br />
			[property:string filename] - The filename to associate with the data provided to this stream. If you want a file in a subdirectory, use forward slashes as a separator (e.g. `directory/filename.ext`). This will still work on Windows.<br />
			[property:number flag]? - Bits 1 and 2 of the general purpose bit flag, specified in PKZIP's APPNOTE.txt, section 4.4.4. Should be between 0 and 3. This is unlikely to be necessary.<br />
			[property:string|number|Date mtime]? - When the file was last modified. Defaults to the current time.<br />
			[property:AsyncFlateStreamHandler ondata]? - The handler to be called when data is added. After passing this stream to the ZIP file object, this handler will always be defined. To call it:<br />
			`stream.ondata(error, chunk, final)`<br />
			error = any error that occurred (null if there was no error)<br />
			chunk = a Uint8Array of the data that was added (null if there was an<br />
			error)<br />
			final = boolean, whether this is the final chunk in the stream<br />
			[property:number os]? - The operating system of origin for this file. The value is defined by PKZIP's APPNOTE.txt, section 4.4.2.2. For example, 0 (the default) is MS/DOS, 3 is UNIX, 19 is macOS.<br />
			[property:number size] - The size of the file in bytes. This attribute may be invalid after the file is added to the ZIP archive; it must be correct only before the stream completes.<br />
			If you don't want to have to compute this yourself, consider extending the ZipPassThrough class and overriding its process() method, or using one of ZipDeflate or AsyncZipDeflate.<br />
			[property:AsyncTerminable terminate]? - A method called when the stream is no longer needed, for clean-up purposes. This will not always be called after the stream completes, so you may wish to call this.terminate() after the final chunk is processed if you have clean-up logic.
