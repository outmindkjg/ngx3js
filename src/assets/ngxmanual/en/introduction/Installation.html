		<p>
			You can install ngx3js with [link:https://www.npmjs.com/ npm] and modern
			build tools, or get started quickly with just static hosting or a CDN. For
			most users, installing from npm is the best choice.
		</p>

		<p>
			Whichever you choose, be consistent and import all files from the same
			version of the library. Mixing files from different sources may cause
			duplicate code to be included, or even break the application in unexpected
			ways.
		</p>

		<p>
			All methods of installing ngx3js depend on ES modules (see
			[link:https://eloquentjavascript.net/10_modules.html#h_hF2FmOVxw7 Eloquent JavaScript: ECMAScript Modules]), which allow you to include only the
			parts of the library needed in the final project.
		</p>

		<h2>Install from npm</h2>

		<p>
			To install the [link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx3js ngx3js] npm
			module, open a terminal window in your project folder and run:
		</p>

		<h3>Ngx3js Install - Method 1 - Recommanded </h3>
		<code data-type="shell">
			npm install -g @angular/cli
			ng new my-app
			cd my-app
			npm install --save ngx3js 
			node ./node_modules/ngx3js/bin/patch.js
		</code>

		<h3>Ngx3js Install - Method 2 - Optional</h3>
		<code data-type="shell">
			npm install -g @angular/cli
			ng new my-app
			cd my-app
			npm install --save ngx3js 
			npm install --save three@0.136.0
			npm install --save-dev @types/three@0.136.1
		</code>

		<h3>angular.json - set asset options &amp; allowedCommonJsDependencies </h3>
		<code data-type="json">
			{
				"projects": {
				  "your-project-name": {
					"architect": {
					  "build": {
						"options": {
						  "assets": [
							  {
								  "glob": "**/*",
								  "input": "./node_modules/ngx3js/assets",
								  "output": "/assets/examples/"
							  }
						  ],
						  "scripts": [
							"node_modules/ngx3js/assets/js/libs/lottie_canvas.js" // optional
						  ] 
						},
					  },
					}
				  }
				},
			}
		</code>
		<p>
			The package will be downloaded and installed. Then you're ready to import
			it in your code:
		</p>

		<h3>src/app/app.module.ts - NgModule imports</h3>
		<code data-type="ts">
			import { Ngx3JsModule } from 'ngx3js';

			@NgModule({
				....
				imports: [..., Ngx3JsModule],
				....
			})
		</code>

		<h3>src/app/app.component.ts - setAssetUrl </h3>
		<code data-type="ts">
			import { ThreeUtil } from 'ngx3js';

			export class AppComponent {
				ngOnInit(): void {
				  // any where use ngx3js for just one time
				  ThreeUtil.setAssetUrl('assets/examples/');
				}
			}
		</code>

		<h2>Examples</h2>

		<p>
			The core of ngx3js is focused on the most important components of a 3D
			engine. Many other useful components — such as controls, loaders, and
			post-processing effects — are part of the
			[link:https://github.com/outmindkjg/ngx3js/tree/master/src/app/examples examples] directory. They are referred to as "examples," because while you
			can use them off the shelf, they're also meant to be remixed and
			customized. These components are always kept in sync with the core
			library, whereas similar third-party packages on npm are maintained by
			different people and may not be up to date.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's important that all files use the same version. Do not import
			different examples from different versions, or use examples from a
			different version than the ngx3js library itself.
		</p>

		<h2>Compatibility</h2>

		<h3>CommonJS imports</h3>

		<p>
			While most modern JavaScript bundlers now support ES modules by default,
			some older build tools might not. In those cases you can likely configure
			the bundler to understand ES modules: [link:http://browserify.org/Browserify] just needs the [link:https://github.com/babel/babelify babelify] plugin, for example.
		</p>

		<h3>Node.js</h3>

		<p>
			Using ngx3js in [link:https://eloquentjavascript.net/20_node.html Node.js]
			can be difficult, for two reasons:
		</p>

		<p>
			First, because ngx3js is built for the web, it depends on browser and DOM
			APIs that don't always exist in Node.js. Some of these issues can be
			resolved by using shims like [link:https://github.com/stackgl/headless-gl headless-gl], or by replacing components like [page:TextureLoader] with
			custom alternatives. Other DOM APIs may be deeply intertwined with the
			code that uses them, and will be harder to work around. We welcome simple
			and maintainable pull requests to improve Node.js support, but recommend
			opening an issue to discuss your improvements first.
		</p>

		<p>
			Second, Node.js support for ES modules is ... complicated. As of Node.js
			v12, the core library can be imported as a CommonJS module, with
			<em>require('three')</em>. However, most example components in
			<em>examples/jsm</em> cannot. Future versions of Node.js may resolve this,
			but in the meantime you may need to use workarounds like
			[link:https://github.com/standard-things/esm esm] to enable your Node.js
			application to recognize ES modules.
